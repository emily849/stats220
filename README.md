A little about me:

* I am undertaking a *degree* in **Bachelor of Commerce/Bachelor of Science conjoint**. My majors are:
1. Economics
2. Finance
3. Statistics

* I am taking *STATS 220* because I want to better understand computer technologies and being able to see the practical application of statistics.
