# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Bachelor of Commerce/Bachelor of Science conjoint.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to better understand computer technologies and being able to see the practical application of statistics. 
- I am interested in learning about wrangling data and being able to tidy data up.
